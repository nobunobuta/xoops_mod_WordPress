SPAW Editor PHP Edition
version 1.1 Beta
Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded, tried and supported SPAW Editor!

OK. Here's long awaited Gecko compatible version of SPAW Editor PHP Edition!
As you may have noticed it's named 1.1 Beta. This means it wasn't thoroughly
tested and some features are still missing. So far it was tested only on
Firefox 1.0 on Windows and it seems to work ok. It should work fine on IE
cause we tried not mess with IE code alot.

Here's the list of know issues and limitations in Gecko implementation. Please,
don't report these as bugs!

- Active toolbar is not implemented, yet
- Cut, Copy and Paste function aren't available cause they are disabled in
  Mozilla for security reasons and it takes editing config files to enable them
- Word cleanup is not implemented, yet
- Borders on borderless objects feature is not implemented
- Table functions (insert/delete row/column, merge/split cells) are not yet
  implemented (but you can insert/delete rows/columns visually in gecko)
- Dialogs aren't really modal. So you can bug the behavior if you move cursor 
  in the editor area while dialog is open.
- Dialogs look a bit different compared to IE in "default" theme (theme wasn't 
  updated yet)
- In hyperlink dialog non-applicable rows aren't hidden (like in IE) when
  switching between link, anchor and link to anchor
- You need to change paragraph values in config file to <H1>, <H2>, etc. in 
  order for paragraphs to work in Gecko. It will also work in IE but wont
  be reflected in active toolbar
- Sometimes it is necessary to reload the page to make it work
- Documentation is not updated
